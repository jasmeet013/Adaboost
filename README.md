# Adaboost
adaboost (Adaptive Boosting) is an ensemble technique that attempts to create a strong classifier from a number of weak classifiers.In the program the Adaboost classifier is used in aggregation with decision tree to do predictions in superstore data set.The numerical features are chosen as the dependent variables at x and the categorical variable are chosen for the y as independent variable.At the end the confusion matrix is created. The label encoder is used to encode the levels of categorical features into numeric values in y.
